# Changelog

## 1.0.5 (2015/11/02)

### New features

All API errors returned by the SDK now contain a `requestID` property that uniquely identifies the client request. It is useful to report the request ID when making bug reports. The request ID will also appear in stringified versions of the error.

## 1.0.4 (2015/10/23)

### Breaking changes

The `package.json` file in previous releases contained an erroneous value for the `version` attribute ("1.0.16"). Starting with this release, the version should be kept in sync with the release label, which is currently **1.0.4**.

### New features

#### Refactored errors

The client now returns more robust error objects.

Errors produced by the Chain SDK have a `chainErrorType` property. The types are exported under the object `chain.errors`.

So far, there are three error types:

`chainErrorType` | Meaning
--- | ---
`chain.errors.api` | An codified error with code, message, and details provided by the API server.
`chain.errors.connectivity` | A valid HTTP response was received, but a specific header was missing. This usually implies a network error on the client side, such as a misconfigured proxy.
`chain.errors.json` | An HTTP response was received, but the response body could not be parsed. This usually implies a bug in the Chain API server.

#### Renamed list retrieval methods

List retrieval methods all use the prefix `list` instead of `get`. The old `get`-prefixed functions are now deprecated.

Old | New
--- | ---
`getAccounts` | `listAccounts`
`getAccountActivity` | `listAccountActivity`
`getAccountBalances` | `listAccountBalances`
`getAssets` | `listAssets`
`getAssetActivity` | `listAssetActivity`
`getIssuerNodes` | `listIssuerNodes`
`getIssuerNodeActivity` | `listIssuerNodeActivity`
`getManagerNodes` | `listManagerNodes`
`getManagerNodeActivity` | `listManagerNodeActivity`
`getManagerNodeBalances` | `listManagerNodeBalances`

### Deprecated features

See **Renamed list retrieval methods** above for a list of deprecated method names.
